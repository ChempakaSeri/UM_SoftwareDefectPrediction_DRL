%
%    A. Gunes Koru and Hongfang Liu, "An Investigation of the Effect 
% of Module Size on Defect Prediction Using Static Measures", PROMISE - 
% Predictive Models in Software Engineering Workshop, ICSE 2005, 
% May 15th 2005, Saint Louis, Missouri, US.
%
% We used several machine learning algorithms to predict the defective
% modules in five NASA products, namely, CM1, JM1, KC1, KC2, and PC1.
% A set of static measures were used as predictor variables. While doing
% so, we observed that a large portion of the modules were small, as
% measured by lines of code (LOC). When we experimented on the data
% subsets created by partitioning according to module size, we obtained
% higher prediction performance for the subsets that include larger
% modules. We also performed defect prediction using class-level data
% for KC1 rather than method-level data. In this case, the use of class-level
% data resulted in improved prediction performance compared to using
% method-level data. These findings suggest that quality assurance activities
% can be guided even better if defect predictions are made by using
% data that belong to larger modules.
%
% 5. Features:
%
% The descriptions of the features are taken from 
% http://mdp.ivv.nasa.gov/mdp_glossary.html
%
% Feature Used as the Response Variable:
% ======================================
% NUMDEFECTS: The number of defects recorded for the class, 
%
% Features at Class Level Originally
% ==================================
%
% PERCENT_PUB_DATA:  The percentage of data that is public and protected data 
% in a class. In general, lower values indicate greater encapsulation. It is 
% measure of encapsulation.
%
% ACCESS_TO_PUB_DATA: The amount of times that a class's public and protected 
% data is accessed. In general, lower values indicate greater encapsulation. 
% It is a measure of encapsulation.
%
% COUPLING_BETWEEN_OBJECTS: The number of distinct non-inheritance-related 
% classes on which a class depends. If a class that is heavily dependent on 
% many classes outside of its hierarchy is introduced into a library, all the 
% classes upon which it depends need to be introduced as well. This may be 
% acceptable, especially if the classes which it references are already part 
% of a class library and are even more fundamental than the specified class.
%
% DEPTH: The level for a class. For instance, if a parent has one child the 
% depth for the child is two. Depth indicates at what level a class is located 
% within its class hierarchy. In general, inheritance increases when depth 
% increases. 
%
% LACK_OF_COHESION_OF_METHODS: For each data field in a class, the percentage 
% of the methods in the class using that data field; the percentages are 
% averaged then subtracted from 100%. The locm metric indicates low or 
% high percentage of cohesion. If the percentage is low, the class is cohesive.
% If it is high, it may indicate that the class could be split into separate 
% classes that will individually have greater cohesion. 
%
% NUM_OF_CHILDREN: The number of classes derived from a specified class.
%
% DEP_ON_CHILD: Whether a class is dependent on a descendant.
%
% FAN_IN: This is a count of calls by higher modules.
%
% RESPONSE_FOR_CLASS: A count of methods implemented within a class plus the 
% number of methods accessible to an object class due to inheritance. In 
% general, lower values indicate greater polymorphism. 
%
% WEIGHTED_METHODS_PER_CLASS: A count of methods implemented within a class 
% (rather than all methods accessible within the class hierarchy). In general, 
% lower values indicate greater polymorphism.


% Features Transformed to Class Level (Originally at Method Level)
% ================================================================ 
%
% Transformation was achieved by obtaining min, max, sum, and avg values
% over all the methods in a class. There this data set includes four 
% features for all of the following features that were originally at the
% method level but transformed to the class level. For example, LOC_BLANK 
% has minLOC_BLANK, maxLOC_BLANK, avgLOC_BLANK, and maxLOC_BLANK.
%
% LOC_BLANK: Lines with only white space or no text content.
%
% BRANCH_COUNT: This metric is the number of branches for each module. 
% Branches are defined as those edges that exit from a decision node. 
% The greater the number of branches in a program's modules, the more 
% testing resource's required.
%
% LOC_CODE_AND_COMMENT: Lines that contain both code and comment. 
%
% LOC_COMMENTS:  The number of lines in a module. This particular metric 
% includes all blank lines, comment lines, and source lines.
%
% CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY: It is a measure of the complexity of a modules 
% decision structure. It is the number of linearly independent paths.
%
% DESIGN_COMPLEXITY: Design complexity is a measure of a module's decision 
% structure as it relates to calls to other modules. This quantifies the 
% testing effort related to integration. 
%
% ESSENTIAL_COMPLEXITY: Essential complexity is a measure of the degree to 
% which a module contains unstructured constructs. 
%
% LOC_EXECUTABLE:  Source lines of code that contain only code and white space. 
%
% HALSTEAD_CONTENT: Complexity of a given algorithm independent of the 
% language used to express the algorithm.
%
% HALSTEAD_DIFFICULTY: Level of difficulty in the program.
%
% HALSTEAD_EFFORT: Estimated mental effort required to develop the program.
%
% HALSTEAD_ERROR_EST:  Estimated number of errors in the program.
%
% HALSTEAD_LENGTH: This is a Halstead metric that includes the total number 
% of operator occurrences and total number of operand occurrences. 
%
% HALSTEAD_LEVEL: Level at which the program can be understood. 
%
% HALSTEAD_PROG_TIME: Estimated amount of time to implement the algorithm.
%
% HALSTEAD_VOLUME: This is a Halstead metric that contains the minimum 
% number of bits required for coding the program. 
%
% NUM_OPERANDS: Variables and identifiers Constants (numeric literal/string) 
% Function names when used during calls. 
%
% NUM_UNIQUE_OPERANDS: Variables and identifiers Constants 
% (numeric literal/string) Function names when used during calls
%
% NUM_UNIQUE_OPERATORS: Number of unique operators.
%
% LOC_TOTAL: Total Lines of Code.
